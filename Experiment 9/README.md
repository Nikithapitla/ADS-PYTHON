Experiment 10


Aim of the experiment - Write a program for implementing Knuth-Morris-Pratt pattern matching algorithm.


procedure for the experiment

The KMP matching algorithm uses degenerating property (pattern having same sub-patterns appearing more 
than once in the pattern) of the pattern and improves the worst case complexity to O(n). 
The basic idea behind KMP’s algorithm is: whenever we detect a mismatch (after some matches), 
we already know some of the characters in the text of the next window. We take advantage of this
information to avoid matching the characters that we know will anyway match. KMP algorithm preprocesses 
pat[] and constructs an auxiliary lps[] of size m (same as size of pattern) which is used to skip characters while matching.
name lps indicates longest proper prefix which is also suffix.. A proper prefix is prefix with whole string not allowed.
For example, prefixes of “ABC” are “”, “A”, “AB” and “ABC”. Proper prefixes are “”, “A” and “AB”. Suffixes of the string
are “”, “C”, “BC” and “ABC”. We search for lps in sub-patterns. More clearly we focus on sub-strings of patterns that are 
either prefix and suffix. For each sub-pattern pat[0..i] where i = 0 to m-1, lps[i] stores length of the maximum matching
proper prefix which is also a suffix of the sub-pattern pat[0..i]. Unlike Naive algorithm, where we slide the pattern by 
one and compare all characters at each shift, we use a value from lps[] to decide the next characters to be matched. 
The idea is to not match a character that we know will anyway match. How to use lps[] to decide next positions (or to 
know a number of characters to be skipped)? We start comparison of pat[j] with j = 0 with characters of current window 
of text. We keep matching characters txt[i] and pat[j] and keep incrementing i and j while pat[j] and txt[i] keep matching. 
When we see a mismatch We know that characters pat[0..j-1] match with txt[i-j…i-1] (Note that j starts with 0 and increment
it only when there is a match). We also know (from above definition) that lps[j-1] is count of characters of pat[0…j-1]
that are both proper prefix and suffix. From above two points, we can conclude that we 
do not need to match these lps[j-1] characters with txt[i-j…i-1] because we know that these characters will anyway match. 
Let us consider above example to understand this.
