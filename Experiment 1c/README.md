EXperiment 1C:
Aim of the experiment - Write a program to perform the following operations:
1c)search for a element from Binary search tree

procedure for the experiment:
Let’s say we want to search for the number, what we’ll do is we’ll start at the root,
and then we will compare the value to be searched with the value of the root if it’s equal
we are done with the search if it’s lesser we know that we need to go to the left subtree
because in a binary search tree all the elements in the left subtree are lesser
and all the elements in the right subtree are greater.
Searching an element in the binary search tree is basically this traversal in which at
each step we will go either towards left or right and hence in at each step we discard one of the sub-trees. 
If the tree is balanced, we call a tree balanced if for all nodes 
the difference between the heights of left and right subtrees is not greater than one, 
we will start with a search space of ‘n’nodes and when we will discard one of the sub-trees we will discard ‘n/2’ nodes
so our search space will be reduced to ‘n/2’ and then in the next step we will reduce the search space to ‘n/4’ and
we will go on reducing like this till we find the element or till our search space is reduced to only one node.
The search here is also a binary search and that’s why the name binary search tree.
