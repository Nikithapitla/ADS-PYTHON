Experiment 1a
Aim of the experiment - Write a program to perform the following operations:
7a)Insert an element into a AVL tree

procedure for the experiment Insertion of a key
To make sure that the given tree remains AVL after every insertion, we must augment the standard BST insert operation to perform some re-balancing. 
Following are two basic operations that can be performed to re-balance a BST without violating the BST property (keys(left) < key(root) < keys(right)).

1.Left Rotation
2.Right Rotation Let the newly inserted node be w
3.Perform standard BST insert for w.
4.Starting from w, travel up and find the first unbalanced node. Let z be the first unbalanced node, y be the child of z that comes on the path
from w to z and w be the grandchild of z that comes on the path from w to z.
5.Re-balance the tree by performing appropriate rotations on the subtree rooted with z. There can be 4 possible cases that needs to be handled 
as x, y and z can be arranged in 4 ways. Following are the possible 4 arrangements: a) y is left child of z and x is left child of y 
(Left Left Case) b) y is left child of z and x is right child of y (Left Right Case) c) y is right child of z and x is right child of y (Right Right Case) d)
y is right child of z and x is left child of y (Right Left Case) Following are the operations to be performed in above mentioned 4 cases. In all of the cases,
we only need to re-balance the subtree rooted
with z and the complete tree becomes balanced as the height of subtree (After appropriate rotations) rooted with z becomes same as it was before insertion.
