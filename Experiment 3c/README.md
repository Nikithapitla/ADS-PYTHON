Experiment 3c

Aim of the experiment - Write a program to perform the following operations:

3c)search for a element from B tree

procedure for the experiment:


The search operation is the simplest operation on B Tree. 
The following algorithm is applied: Let the key (the value) to be searched by "k". 
Start searching from the root and recursively traverse down. If k is lesser than the root value, 
search left subtree, if k is greater than the root value, search the right subtree. If the node has the found k,
simply return the node. If the k is not found in the node, traverse down to the child with a greater key. 
If k is not found in the tree, we return NULL.
