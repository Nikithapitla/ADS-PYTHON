Experiment 4a
Aim of the experiment - Write a program to perform the following operations:
4a)Insert an element into a Min-Max heap

procedure for the experiment Insertion of a key
Inserting a new key takes O(Log n) time. We add a new key at the end of the tree. 
If new key is larger than its parent, then we donâ€™t need to do anything. Otherwise, we need to traverse up to fix the violated heap property.
