Experiment 12


Aim of the experiment - Write a program for implementing Boyer pattern matching algorithm
procedure for the experiment


Boyer Moore is a combination of following two approaches.

1.Bad Character Heuristic.

2.Good Suffix Heuristic Both of the above heuristics can also be used independently to search a pattern in a text.
If we take a look at the Naive algorithm, it slides the pattern over the text one by one. 
KMP algorithm does preprocessing over the pattern so that the pattern can be shifted by more than one. 
The Boyer Moore algorithm does preprocessing for the same reason. 
It processes the pattern and creates different arrays for both heuristics.
At every step, it slides the pattern by the max of the slides suggested by the two heuristics.
So it uses best of the two heuristics at every step. Unlike the previous pattern searching algorithms,
Boyer Moore algorithm starts matching from the last character of the pattern.
The idea of bad character heuristic is simple. The character of the text which doesn’t match
with the current character of the pattern is called the Bad Character. Upon mismatch, we shift the pattern until –

3.The mismatch becomes a match
Pattern P move past the mismatched character. 
Case 1 – Mismatch become match We will lookup 
the position of last occurrence of mismatching character in pattern and 
if mismatching character exist in pattern then we’ll shift the pattern such that 
it get aligned to the mismatching character in text T. Case 2 – Pattern move past
the mismatch character We’ll lookup the position of last occurrence of mismatching
character in pattern and if character does not exist we will shift pattern past the mismatching character.
